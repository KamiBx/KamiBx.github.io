<p> Hello everyone, and welcome to my guide on the game paladins, by Hi-Rez studios.
Please note that I do not own the game and am only explaining about the game for educational purposes.
Without further distraction, lets get into the guide.
</p>
<p>
First of all what kind of game is Paladins? Paladins is a first person shooter video game developed by Evil Mojo Games (development studio under the Hi-Rez Studios publishing group). It consists of different playable characters (champions) that each have unique abilities they bring to the field. Each character has a role that they specialize in which revolves around how the character is meant to be played.
</p>
<h4>The Different Roles</h4>
<p>There are 4 roles of characters in Paladins which consist of frontlines, damages, supports and flanks. They each have their pros and cons that can easily be distinguished.</p>
