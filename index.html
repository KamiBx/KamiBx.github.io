<p>Hello, I am known as Kami or Bx, whatever your comfortable calling me.
Since I have noticed that I am usually teaching people how to do things in
many games, I thought I would make a website and dedicate it to having short tutorials,
or guides on how to play the game. Many of the things are required in game, and other things
are opinions. I hope you enjoy roaming my site, and have fun while doing so, you might 
learn something new!
