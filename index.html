<strong>The Ancient Ghost Feather</strong><br>
<b>Code-named Bx, Kami, or "God"</b>, he is the fearless leader of the clan.<br>
Has special talents in using a sniper and various one shot weapons.<br>
He can also turn himself invisible with the flick of his wrist, rendering <br>
him clear and completely unseen. This allows him to take out targets <br>
before they are even aware of his presence. He is a stealthy person. <br>
He also has talents with pistols and knives. <i>He also enjoys watching <br>
the suffering of his enemies as they perish beneath him as he takes <br>
them out in a matter of seconds.</i> He is also the master <br>
of rekting scrubby boy and laughing like a retard. He often <br>
tries to defend Sean E Dawgs in battle because he doesn't like it <br>
whenever some decides to <b>CHALLENGE SEAN</b>. However when his <br>
enemies decided to play dirty and attack his team from the back, <br>
he is always there, you just can't see him after he says <b>"I'm gone..."</b>


</p>

       <p id="Bryan">
<strong>The Lost Hand of Justice</strong><br>
<b>Code-named Shadow, Shadow_Skull, PhantomXFantasy, but mainly "Criminal Bryan"</b>,<br>
he is one of the most offensive in the team. He always wants to strike from the shadows <br>
using his criminal skills to hack into people's accounts on anything, revealing their <br>
personal information. Basically he can just find your ip and visit your house <br>
as he pleases. He is a valuable asset to the clan as he is the only one with this <br>
detection prowess. He also wields silent weapons like smgs or pistols to make sure <br>
his target doesn't see him as he <i>"comes to their house when he's ready"</i>. <br>
The FBI doesn't have shit on him at all. They can't even see him on the satelite. <br>
He mainly works with Sean E Sawgs because they are compatible together and also Bryan <br>
works side by side with TigerEyes slaying enemies in battle and raising flags for the clan. <br>
He loves to tell his opponents,<b>"You're already dead..."</b> But if his enemies manage to run <br>
away, consider them dead, because <b>"no one escapes the law!"</b>

<strong>The Tyrant of The Abyss</strong><br>
Code-named TigersEyes434, he is an invalueble member of the clan. His origins show <br>
he is from Russia and was working under the highest ranked Soviet Union members. <br>
He has an obsession with cats and likes the color pink. He is very stategic when it <br>
come to destroying the enemy. He works closest under the clan leader and is 2nd in command. <br>
He specializes in giving overated reacting to situations and dealing with them fast. <br>
He carries a sword with oil on it and what looks like a purple lamp.<i> He duel wields them <br>
in combat, sending enemies to the oven with his burning sword and stealing their conciousness <br>
with his lamp.</i> The lamp he wields is very mysterious and to the other members, it is unknown what TigerEyes can really do.<br>
Something that may hint toward what he can actually do would be when he says <b>"gather around"</b> which <br>
suddenly draws in enemies around where he dropped this purple orb on the ground. Eh, beats me.<br>
Through his mixed abilities, TigerEyes is able to coexist in battle with Rishi and Bryan <br>
making sure none of them get their asses kicked. But if they do, then Tiger makes sure <br>
give the enemy a nice <b>ZAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!</b>

       <p id="Sean">
<strong>The Fallen of Friends</strong><br>
Code-named Xx_killersgXx, Hemraj Sewnarine, but mainly Sean E Dawgs, he is the youngest in the clan. <br>
He is very talented in staying alive and can't really die because of his power and magic that can <br>
reanimate himself. With this power he has a huge axe that he can use physically but can also disperse <br>
magic from it. He is very powerful when it comes to close range magic and can almost instantly kill coolievybez <br>
if he has to intent to. This doesn't mean his long range magic is bad either. He can channel damage that he <br>
is about to take and release it at his enemies. He can really be helpful when the front lines get messy. <br>
He leaves his enemies trying to figure out what he meant when he said <i>meh</i> after killing them. <br>
Sean E Dawgs has the power to rid of big gey men that may try to approach him or the other clan members. <br>
His older brother, another member of the clan, coolievybez kind of attracts these uh... Big gey men.<br>
This is explicitly the reason that he is body guarding coolievybez most of the time. When his body is weakened <br>
and he starts falling apart, his body regenerates very fast as he shouts <b>"ONCE MORE SEAN RISE!"</b>

       <p id="Rishi">
<strong>The God Slaying Warden</strong><br>
Code-named white vester, gey, mainly coolievybez, this member tends to think high of himself to have <br>
possess higher skill then every other member in the clan. His abilities with a revolver and stone staff <br>
tend to be relativily high. He uses these weapons, not mostly at the same time but he variates with them. <br>
He uses the revolver on targets that tend to have higher health, dropping them very fast, and uses the staff <br>
to keep some crowd control going on. He can be killed slightly easy but his abilities make up for that. His self <br>
confidence is more then what Bryan eats for breakfest, lunch, and dinner, however he isn't the perfect person <br>
he acts like. He tends to try and bully Sean E Dawgs, even though its his little brother. He doesn't care what <br>
people think of him because he rolls his own way and doesn't get influenced by people that much. But when it <br>
is time to send people to the grave, he is well fitted for telling enemies that <b>"you are not welcomed here."</b><br>
He makes sure to check his surroudings and works very well as a cereal killer. He best excels in his hand-to-hand<br>
combat mainly because he is <strike>black</strike> strong physically. When he looks at the time, he knows there is <br>
no better time to relay that <b>"death awaits you all."</b>
