      <p id="Brandon">
<strong>The Ancient Ghost Feather</strong><br>
<b>Code-named Bx, Kami, or "God"</b>, he is the fearless leader of the clan.
Has special talents in using a sniper and various one shot weapons.
He can also turn himself invisible with the flick of his wrist, rendering
him clear and completely unseen. This allows him to take out targets
before they are even aware of his presence. He is a stealthy person.
He also has talents with pistols and knives. <i>He also enjoys watching
the suffering of his enemies as they perish beneath him as he takes
them out in a matter of seconds.</i> He is also the master
of rekting scrubby boy and laughing like a retard. He often
tries to defend Sean E Dawgs in battle because he doesn't like it
whenever some decides to <b>CHALLENGE SEAN</b>. However when his
enemies decided to play dirty and attack his team from the back,
he is always there, you just can't see him after he says <b>"I'm gone..."</b>


</p>

       <p id="Bryan">
<strong>The Lost Hand of Justice</strong><br>
<b>Code-named Shadow, Shadow_Skull, PhantomXFantasy, but mainly "Criminal Bryan"</b>,
he is one of the most offensive in the team. He always wants to strike from the shadows
using his criminal skills to hack into people's accounts on anything, revealing their
personal information. Basically he can just find your ip and visit your house
as he pleases. He is a valuable asset to the clan as he is the only one with this
detection prowess. He also wields silent weapons like smgs or pistols to make sure
his target doesn't see him as he <i>"comes to their house when he's ready"</i>.
The FBI doesn't have shit on him at all. They can't even see him on the satelite.
He mainly works with Sean E Sawgs because they are compatible together and also Bryan
works side by side with TigerEyes slaying enemies in battle and raising flags for the clan.
He loves to tell his opponents,<b>"You're already dead..."</b> But if his enemies manage to run
away, consider them dead, because <b>"no one escapes the law!"</b>

       <p id="Kenrick">
<strong>The Tyrant of The Abyss</strong><br>
<b>Code-named TigersEyes434</b>, he is an invalueble member of the clan. His origins show
he is from Russia and was working under the highest ranked Soviet Union members.
He has an obsession with cats and likes the color pink. He is very stategic when it
come to destroying the enemy. He works closest under the clan leader and is 2nd in command.
He specializes in giving overated reacting to situations and dealing with them fast.
He carries a sword with oil on it and what looks like a purple lamp.<i> He duel wields them
in combat, sending enemies to the oven with his burning sword and stealing their conciousness
with his lamp.</i> The lamp he wields is very mysterious and to the other members, it is unknown what TigerEyes can really do.
Something that may hint toward what he can actually do would be when he says <b>"gather around"</b> which
suddenly draws in enemies around where he dropped this purple orb on the ground. Eh, beats me.
Through his mixed abilities, TigerEyes is able to coexist in battle with Rishi and Bryan
making sure none of them get their asses kicked. But if they do, then Tiger makes sure
give the enemy a nice <b>ZAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!</b>

       <p id="Sean">
<strong>The Fallen of Friends</strong><br>
<b>Code-named Xx_killersgXx, Hemraj Sewnarine, but mainly Sean E Dawgs</b>, he is the youngest in the clan.
He is very talented in staying alive and can't really die because of his power and magic that can
reanimate himself. With this power he has a huge axe that he can use physically but can also disperse
magic from it. He is very powerful when it comes to close range magic and can almost instantly kill coolievybez
if he has to intent to. This doesn't mean his long range magic is bad either. He can channel damage that he
is about to take and release it at his enemies. He can really be helpful when the front lines get messy.
He leaves his enemies trying to figure out what he meant when he said <i>meh</i> after killing them.
Sean E Dawgs has the power to rid of big gey men that may try to approach him or the other clan members.
His older brother, another member of the clan, coolievybez kind of attracts these uh... Big gey men.
This is explicitly the reason that he is body guarding coolievybez most of the time. When his body is weakened
and he starts falling apart, his body regenerates very fast as he shouts <b>"ONCE MORE SEAN RISE!"

       <p id="Rishi">
<strong>The God Slaying Warden</strong><br>
<b>Code-named white vester, gey, mainly coolievybez</b>, this member tends to think high of himself to have
possess higher skill then every other member in the clan. His abilities with a revolver and stone staff
tend to be relativily high. He uses these weapons, not mostly at the same time but he variates with them.
He uses the revolver on targets that tend to have higher health, dropping them very fast, and uses the staff
to keep some crowd control going on. He can be killed slightly easy but his abilities make up for that. His self
confidence is more then what Bryan eats for breakfest, lunch, and dinner, however he isn't the perfect person
he acts like. He tends to try and bully Sean E Dawgs, even though its his little brother. He doesn't care what
people think of him because he rolls his own way and doesn't get influenced by people that much. But when it
is time to send people to the grave, he is well fitted for telling enemies that <b>"you are not welcomed here."</b>
He makes sure to check his surroudings and works very well as a cereal killer. He best excels in his hand-to-hand
combat mainly because he is <strike>black</strike> strong physically. When he looks at the time, he knows there is
no better time to relay that <b>"death awaits you all."</b>
